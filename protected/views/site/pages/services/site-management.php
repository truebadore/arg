					<p class="leadership-body">With a strong focus on building better site relationships and enhancing team communication, our Trial Site Managers (TSMs) provide the critical link between our clients and participating investigative sites.
Frequent, focused and proactive contact between TSMs and Clinical Research Associates within investigative sites is the key to enhancing clinical production at the site level. TSMs are also responsible for all regulatory start-up tasks, including essential document packet submission and processing, regulatory document review and sign-off, IRB submission assistance, feasibility study conduct and management and screening and enrollment tracking.</p><br />
