					<p class="leadership-body">Our dedicated Clinical Monitoring Team, along with our Trial Site Managers, serves as the liaison between the investigative sites and our client. It ensures that all study volunteer rights have been respected, all study data is complete and accurate, and each investigative site remains compliant with the protocol in accordance with all local and federal regulations.
Each ARG Monitor is trained in FDA and ICH/GCP regulations, TrialVista software, and ARG's internal monitoring SOPs. Clinical Monitoring services are available across phases (including post-market analyses), and in proactive communication visits to enhance site relationships and recruitment.</p><br />
